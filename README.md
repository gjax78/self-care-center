# Self Care Center
## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetitive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. I have built an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

## Project Roadmap


1. Create a webpage that looks like the below:

2. When a user selects a message option and then clicks the “Receive Message” button, the user sees a random message from the list of possible messages for that category. When the message appears, the meditation icon disappears from the message area:

3. User can add their own message: When the user clicks “Add Message” a form will appear in the message box. When the user clicks the “Submit” button, that message automatically displays in the message box, instead of the meditation icon:

4. If the user doesn’t specify the type of message, they get an error and are unable to submit their message until the type is specified:
