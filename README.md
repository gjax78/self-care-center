# Self Care Center
## Overview


How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetitive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. I have built an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!
